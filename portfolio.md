This is a portfolio collection of personal items I have worked with online recently.  

I’m also available for consulting, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to work together.

I am interested in:  

- Creative or Ghost blog writing
- Technical writing for IT/OT/Cyber Security
- Email Design and development
- Mobile Progressive Web App (PWA) development
- Algo Trading Strategy Development (FinTech)
