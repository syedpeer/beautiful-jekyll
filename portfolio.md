### My Writings

#### Cyber Security

#### Hacking Magazine 

The modern web and social platforms in particular provide the perfect window into our lives, but are only effective so far as we allow them to be. A fun weekend exercise for young and old alike is just to type your name into the Google Search field and watch all the references that come back to you in an instant. It can be an eye-opening experience that so much information about ourselves (both the good and the bad) is actually out there for the general public to see.

#### Hacking Magazine 

We take for granted as standard fare things these days that have their origins in solutions within other industries (e.g. modern Project Management and Critical Path come to mind from Aerospace), so too was the case with the original “Kill Chain”. Lockheed Martin, a major defense contractor for the US Military (DOD), was instrumental in deriving the “Kill Chain” model based upon its military use case.

#### Hacking Magazine 

As enterprises continue to build on their defense in depth strategies layer-by-layer (ever so slowly though) possibly the most important vector of attack still remains those attacks that originate from within the organization itself - by employees or external consultants.

This area presents a clear and present danger and lack of due diligence can be disastrous for any organization. As the #Cyber #Security #threat landscape evolves (and matures) and the number and frequency of breaches increases, every organization needs to continuously review insider policies and lock down on unnecessary privileges running wild within their staff/team members and consultants.

#### Hacking Magazine 

Enterprise IT #mobile devices now more than ever before pose a new "Mobile Threat Landscape" that expose a surface footprint as diverse, colorful and unregulated as its user base. Mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) now represent the largest single #enterprise computing device growth sector with established heavy duty manufacturers vying for customer loyalty and attention.

Personal #Mobile devices (#BYOD) present some unique challenges for enterprise IT shops that need to be addressed with a balanced strategy that allows users their freedom yet keeps private corporate data ‘sandboxed’ and safe from prying eyes and enterprise applications secured to the finish line.
