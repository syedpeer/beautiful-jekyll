This is a collection of some personal projects I’ve worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

I’m also available for consulting, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to work together.

I am interested in:  

- Creative or Ghost blog writing
- Technical writing for IT/OT/Cyber Security
- Email Design and development
- Mobile Progressive Web App (PWA) development
- Algo Trading Strategy Development (FinTech)
