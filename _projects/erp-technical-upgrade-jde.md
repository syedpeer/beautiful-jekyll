Implemented the technical upgrade from JDE 8.11 to JDE Enterprise One ver.9.1. Collaborating with an offshore ERP Services Provider, originally estimated project to be of 10 month duration. In reality the project was successfully completed and delivered within an 8 month window - ahead of the estimated schedule by 2 months (and within budget). An On-shore off-shore model followed for delivery with 2 ERP techno-functional teams and 4 vendor sourced JDE analysts. A separate offshore team of 4 persons assisted with both core and additonal development.
