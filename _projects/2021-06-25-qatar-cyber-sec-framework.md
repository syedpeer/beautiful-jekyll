Qatar is the host nation for the FIFA Soccer World Cup 2022.

Worked with Ministry of Interior (MOI) and Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications (MOTC/QCERT) to be in compliance of the recently drafted framework in prepartion of the FIFA 2022 World Cup event to be staged in Qatar during the Fall of 2022. The framwork is built ovet a slew of international security and auditing standards including (but not limited to): ISO 27001, ISA99, NIST, COBIT. etc. Over 300 line items identified at the get go, but on account of QAFCO work on ISO 27001, for over 60% QAFCO was already meeting the necessary requirement.
