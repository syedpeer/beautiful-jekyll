One stop shop Business Intelligence (BI) based Decision Support System (DSS) developed internally to assist QAFCO Senior Management (CEO & Chief Oficers) with a unified 40,000 feet high overview of end-of-day major metrics measued within the company. 

Originally built to support Production Department metrics the BI Dashboards were quickly expanded to cover other department business areas covering Administration, HR, Finance and  Maintenance etc.

A small dedicated in-house team of 2/3 developer/analysts employed to connect varied important heterogenous systems across organization (ERP, PIMS, LIMS etc.) to create necessary consolidated views over the data.
