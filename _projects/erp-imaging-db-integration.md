description: Integration between ERP JD Edwards and CIMAGE Imaging Database. 
---

Implemented an in-house solution for the integration of the native CIMAGE technical documentaion / imaging database with the JDE Maintenance Work Order System screens. Technical solution uses Oracle RIAF (Related Information Application Framework) to embed native .Net web page within an ERP split window to provide all part images, specs., reports for all items being worked on as part of the Work Order. Solution provided a fluid single stop solution to bring the two system together without requiring users to maintain two separate system sessions and logins etc.
