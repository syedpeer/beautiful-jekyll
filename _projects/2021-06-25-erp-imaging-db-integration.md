Integration between ERP JD Edwards and CIMAGE Imaging Database to provide seamless and efficient  API based access to Production Technical documents and images with the QAFCO Technical Documentation System (QTDMS). 

Solution was implemented as an in-house project for the integration of the native CIMAGE technical documentaion / imaging database with the ERP JDE Maintenance Work Order (WO) System screens. 

Technical solution utilized Oracle RIAF (Related Information Application Framework) to embed native custom .Net web page within an ERP split window to provide all part images, specs., reports for all items being worked on as part of the Work Order (WO). 

Solution provided a fluid single stop solution to bring the two system together without requiring users to maintain two separate system sessions and logins etc.

**Tech Stack**:

- Oracle ERP JD Edwards 9.1
- Oracle RIAF/CAFE One
- Microsoft ASP.NET
- API Based Web Services
- CIMAGE Imaging Database
