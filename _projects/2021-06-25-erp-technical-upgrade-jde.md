Implemented the technical upgrade from Oracle JD Edwards 8.11 to JD Edwards Enterprise One ver.9.1. 

In collaboration with remote developer teams of an offshore ERP Services Provider, the project was originally estimated to be of 10 month duration. In reality the project was successfully completed and delivered within an 8 month window - ahead of the estimated schedule by 2 months (and within budget). 

Rigorous QA testing and Code Freeze strategy utilized to ensure smooth GO LIVE ETA.

An On-shore off-shore model followed for delivery with 2 ERP techno-functional teams and 4 vendor sourced JDE analysts. A separate offshore team of 4/6 persons assisted with both core and additonal development.

**Tech Stack**:

- Oracle ERP JD Edwards
- Microsoft ASP.Net
- Microsoft Web Services
- On shore off shore model
- Services Provider collaboration
