At no time since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution have manufacturing businesses thrived on the diversification and choice of vendors, the globalization of suppliers and manpower services, and the accelerated growth of the customer base due to improved infrastructure, shipping routes, and the internet.

However, as software has brought immense accessibility and reach to billions of customers, it has also become an Achilles heel when used in concert with bad actors to disrupt, destroy and debilitate otherwise healthy and profitable organizations.

## Definition 

As defined by Wikipedia: 

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><br/>
As defined by Wikipedia "A supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that seeks to damage an organization by targeting less- secure elements in the supply chain. A supply chain attack can occur in any industry, from the financial sector, oil indus- try, to a government sector.”. Although there are many ways to define and explain this term, the key takeaway from this definition is the “less-secure” element that is a constant in all forms of cyber security defense conversations.<br/><br/>
</p>

</blockquote>

Although this definition sounds almost too simplistic it speaks volumes in so far as trying to explain a vast and expansive field of study. An ocean of learning awaits those who would take on this seemingly Herculean task.

## Background

The “modus operandi” of a supply chain attack centers around an individual or team of bad actors targeting an organization not directly (as that would be too obvious) but rather through an external trusted partner or supplier who may have some manner of access to the organization’s systems. This new route for hackers has grown within the last few years and has transformed the attack surfaces significantly from not just the target organization itself but now across all companies, sup- pliers, and service providers that have any manner of touchpoints within the organization.

This now presents a clear and present danger to organizations as sensitive data inside the organization that is accessible by trusted partners outside the organization can now become the source of a data breach or worse still a malware injection. This danger can be compounded if the target organization is a “supplier-of-suppliers” who happen to house sensitive infor- mation about other suppliers on their systems. Like almost everything in the internet age, the danger growth curve is expo- nential in nature.

The graphic below clearly outlines the rise of Python (thru to 2019). 

## Preventing Cyber Attacks

Beyond necessary skills in networking and operating systems the greatest asset for anyone entering the InfoSec space is knowledge of programming. Specifically, the knowledge of Python. This will put you in a great place to exercise both your hacking skills and learn from the best proponents in the field. 

- Although some people may have cringed at the idea of getting into programming (and the associated math) that gets over their heads from earlier bitter experiences in high school (or elsewhere), programming in and of itself can be a very rewarding pursuit both within cyber security field and other domains. This skill is transferable!

- Python through no accident of itself has become the language of choice for hackers worldwide. Its acceptance by the developer communities has been dramatic and places it at the forefront of others languages within this domain (and others). This is evidenced by the large number of Python repositories and tools available on Github alone. A cursory review found that well over 20% of all exploits and attack tools were written in Python. 

The chart below sheds clarity on this particular programming phenomenon and the degree to which Python has taken the lead in this domain.

- The two most popular Python modules used for web-based attacks were “Urllib” and “Requests”. Another newer module “Async IO” is also gaining ground recently as it fits in perfectly for “Layer 7 DDos” type attacks.

- Analysis done on sites that were attacked shows that an alarming 77% were initiated by a Python based tool and in over 30% of cases a Python based tool was responsible for the daily attacks under the APT umbrella.

- Python is also well placed for attack on some of the most popular frameworks used on the web, such as Joomla, Drupal, WordPress, PHP and Struts. 

In short, there is ample evidence within business and industry that Python is becoming the de facto language for exploit development and attacks. 

## Benefits

Organizations need to looking at some of the following steps as a minimum requirement if they are to prevent embarrassing repeat attacks due to VPN vulnerabilities.

1.	**Ease of Use**: Although Python is a high-level language it is still far easier to learn than other languages such as Java, JavaScript, C++, C# etc.  This is one of its biggest draws for new developers and young learners evidenced by the sky-high sales of the Raspberry PI for schools and first-time programming students which comes bundled with Python on board. Being so beginner friendly it’s possible to write some basic programs within a few hours of starting your learning path.

2.	**Open Source**: Python is both Free and Open Source and has been available for several platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.) for download from its official website at python.org. The source code is freely available to the public.

3.	**Interpreted Language**: As a high-level language Python is an interpreted language that executes a single line of code instruction at a time. Unlike other languages such as Java, C++ or C# there is no compilation stage to create the executable. This shortens the development time to test new features and changes and is somewhat easier to debug at a line by line level. Python is converted to bytecode at execution time.  

4.	**Portability**: Being an interpreted language, Python code has the added benefit of being portable across platforms. Python code developed initially on Windows for example will run “unaltered” on other platforms such as Unix, Linux, Mac etc. In this way the Python programming language really lives up to the axiom of “write once, run everywhere”.

5.	**Object Oriented**: Python comes standard with necessary features for Object Oriented Programming (OOP), supporting classes, inheritance and object/data encapsulation etc. This makes it a lot easier for programmers coming from other languages to jump in quickly and make use of the powerful OOP features that are natively supported within Python. 

6.	**Exploit Writing**: Being a general-purpose language Python is used extensively for exploit writing by hackers worldwide.  It is the language of choice for millions of hackers and remains the foremost tool for writing exploits, hacking scripts and malware. It would be foolish for any aspiring cyber security student to ignore its importance in this area.

7.	**Large Standard Library**: Python is blessed with a large standard library of functions and modules so that you do not need to reinvent the wheel. Many libraries provide the necessary functionality for web surfing, regular expressions (regex), and unit testing just to name a few. This ready tool belt of functions means a huge step up boost for developers from the get go.

8.	**Extensibility**: Python is by nature an extensible language. The availability of ready-made modules makes hacking easier with Python. Modules are available based on the target audience and platform; OS modules, socket modules, web scraping etc. Python may also be used for socket programming for discovering vulnerabilities in target systems.

9.	**Huge Community**: Python has an enormous community of users, contributors and third-party tool builders. Python has a low entry bar for beginners and provides the perfect tool for writing automation scripts and prototyping ideas quickly and confidently across domains.

## Conclusion

For all the reasons above, and some I may have missed, it should be manifestly clear to the reader by now that Python is the language of choice for cyber security professionals. Take the time to do your own research and see how much you can expand your frame of reference by adding a programming language to your tool belt. Just make sure its Python!
