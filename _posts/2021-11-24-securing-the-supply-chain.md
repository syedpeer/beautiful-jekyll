At no time since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution have manufacturing businesses thrived on the diversification and choice of vendors, the globalization of suppliers and manpower services, and the accelerated growth of the customer base due to improved infrastructure, shipping routes, and the internet...

However, as software has brought immense accessibility and reach to billions of customers, it has also become an Achilles heel when used in concert with bad actors to disrupt, destroy and debilitate otherwise healthy and profitable organizations.

## Definition 

As defined by Wikipedia: 

<blockquote>

<p align="left"><br/>
As defined by Wikipedia "A supply chain attack is a cyber-attack that seeks to damage an organization by targeting less- secure elements in the supply chain. A supply chain attack can occur in any industry, from the financial sector, oil indus- try, to a government sector.”. Although there are many ways to define and explain this term, the key takeaway from this definition is the “less-secure” element that is a constant in all forms of cyber security defense conversations.<br/><br/>
</p>

</blockquote>

Although this definition sounds almost too simplistic it speaks volumes in so far as trying to explain a vast and expansive field of study. An ocean of learning awaits those who would take on this seemingly Herculean task.

## Background

The “modus operandi” of a supply chain attack centers around an individual or team of bad actors targeting an organization not directly (as that would be too obvious) but rather through an external trusted partner or supplier who may have some manner of access to the organization’s systems. This new route for hackers has grown within the last few years and has transformed the attack surfaces significantly from not just the target organization itself but now across all companies, sup- pliers, and service providers that have any manner of touchpoints within the organization.

This now presents a clear and present danger to organizations as sensitive data inside the organization that is accessible by trusted partners outside the organization can now become the source of a data breach or worse still a malware injection. This danger can be compounded if the target organization is a “supplier-of-suppliers” who happen to house sensitive infor- mation about other suppliers on their systems. Like almost everything in the internet age, the danger growth curve is expo- nential in nature.

## Prevent Cyber Attacks

Besides the basic rule of thumb to always work to reduce the attack surface of an organization, a number of steps can be taken both by manufacturers and suppliers to prevent attacks and harden system integrity.

1.	**Supplier Security Standards and Policy**: Manufacturers should hold suppliers in their supply chain accountable by issuing necessary Cyber Security Standard documents or policies that they must abide by to win business and orders from the manufacturer. Larger industry vendors may already be following this regime with their customers, so it’s only a matter of validating compliance for them, but smaller vendors will be challenged in this area due to increased staffing costs and skills needed to comply.

2.	**Open Source**: Python is both Free and Open Source and has been available for several platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.) for download from its official website at python.org. The source code is freely available to the public.

3.	**Interpreted Language**: As a high-level language Python is an interpreted language that executes a single line of code instruction at a time. Unlike other languages such as Java, C++ or C# there is no compilation stage to create the executable. This shortens the development time to test new features and changes and is somewhat easier to debug at a line by line level. Python is converted to bytecode at execution time.  

4.	**Portability**: Being an interpreted language, Python code has the added benefit of being portable across platforms. Python code developed initially on Windows for example will run “unaltered” on other platforms such as Unix, Linux, Mac etc. In this way the Python programming language really lives up to the axiom of “write once, run everywhere”.

5.	**Object Oriented**: Python comes standard with necessary features for Object Oriented Programming (OOP), supporting classes, inheritance and object/data encapsulation etc. This makes it a lot easier for programmers coming from other languages to jump in quickly and make use of the powerful OOP features that are natively supported within Python. 

6.	**Exploit Writing**: Being a general-purpose language Python is used extensively for exploit writing by hackers worldwide.  It is the language of choice for millions of hackers and remains the foremost tool for writing exploits, hacking scripts and malware. It would be foolish for any aspiring cyber security student to ignore its importance in this area.

7.	**Large Standard Library**: Python is blessed with a large standard library of functions and modules so that you do not need to reinvent the wheel. Many libraries provide the necessary functionality for web surfing, regular expressions (regex), and unit testing just to name a few. This ready tool belt of functions means a huge step up boost for developers from the get go.

8.	**Extensibility**: Python is by nature an extensible language. The availability of ready-made modules makes hacking easier with Python. Modules are available based on the target audience and platform; OS modules, socket modules, web scraping etc. Python may also be used for socket programming for discovering vulnerabilities in target systems.

9.	**Huge Community**: Python has an enormous community of users, contributors and third-party tool builders. Python has a low entry bar for beginners and provides the perfect tool for writing automation scripts and prototyping ideas quickly and confidently across domains.

## Conclusion

For all the reasons above, and some I may have missed, it should be manifestly clear to the reader by now that Python is the language of choice for cyber security professionals. Take the time to do your own research and see how much you can expand your frame of reference by adding a programming language to your tool belt. Just make sure its Python!
