To write or not to write. That is the question. Under what circumstances should we step off a tried and tested path and wander into the unknown? When is it essential that we finish what we start? These are important questions that must be answered before we begin. 

If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?
