To write or not to write. That is the question. Under what circumstances should we step off the tried and tested path and wander into the unknown? Risk taking is a part of every day life yet so few os us are prepared to take that leap of faith. When is it essential that we finish what we start? 

If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?
