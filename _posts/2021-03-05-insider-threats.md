As enterprises continue to build on their defense in depth strategies layer-by-layer (ever so slowly though) possibly the most important vector of attack still remains those attacks that originate from within the organization itself - by employees or external consultants.

This area presents a clear and present danger and lack of due diligence can be disastrous for any organization. As the **Cyber Security** threat landscape evolves (and matures) and the number and frequency of breaches increases, every organization needs to continuously review insider policies and lock down on unnecessary privileges running wild within their staff/team members and consultants.
